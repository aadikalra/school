# Hello Mrs. Crawford!

## Uhh, yeah.

This is real btw. Presenting... **TrashTag**.

## What is TrashTag?

TrashTag is my first attempt at a very complex app. It’s simple: see trash, report it. We're out here trying to make the world a little cleaner, one tagged piece of trash at a time. 

## Features

- **Home**: Where it all begins. Your starting point for reporting trash.
- **Recycle**: Because we love the environment, and so should you.
- **About**: Why we care and why you should too. Spoiler alert: Trash is bad.
- **Account**: Create an account and track your trash-tagging stats. Flex on your friends with how much trash you’ve reported!
- **Log In**: Because tagging trash is serious business.

## How It Works

1. See trash on a trail? Open the app.
2. Report the trash location, and we’ll handle the rest.
3. Feel great for doing your part in reducing litter!

## Languages & Tools...
- **React (JS)**: My favorite organizing tool!
- **Express & NPM**: To get this running
- **CSS**: The best thing in the world :)
- **Google Account Login**: The best way to login/signup!!

*Not all features are working yet, I will be implementing them soon though.
